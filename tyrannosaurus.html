            <strong>Tyrannosaurus</strong> is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The type species <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often shortened to <strong>T. rex</strong> or colloquially <strong>t-rex</strong>, is one of the best represented theropods.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            It lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as <strong>Laramidia</strong>. <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of geological formations dating to the latest <strong>Campanian–Maastrichtian</strong> ages of the late Cretaceous period, <strong>72.7 to 66 million years ago</strong>, with isolated specimens possibly indicating an earlier origin in the middle Campanian. It was the <strong>last known member of the tyrannosaurids</strong> and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the <strong>Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Anatomy and Physiology</h2>
        <p>
            Like other tyrannosaurids, <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> was a <strong>bipedal carnivore</strong> with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> were <strong>short but unusually powerful for their size</strong>, and they had <strong>two clawed digits</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most complete specimen measures <strong>12.3–12.4 m (40–41 ft)</strong> in length, but according to most modern estimates, <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> could have exceeded sizes of <strong>15 m (49 ft)</strong> in length, approximately <strong>4 m (13 ft)</strong> in hip height, and <strong>15 metric tons (33,000 lb)</strong> in mass.<a href="#ref1" class="citation">[1]</a> Although some other theropods might have rivaled or exceeded <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> in size, it is still among the <strong>largest known land predators</strong>, with its estimated bite force being the <strong>largest among all terrestrial animals</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Ecology and Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            By far the largest carnivore in its environment, <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> was most likely an <strong>apex predator</strong>, preying upon <strong>hadrosaurs</strong>, juvenile armored herbivores like <strong>ceratopsians</strong> and <strong>ankylosaurs</strong>, and possibly <strong>sauropods</strong>. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a <strong>scavenger</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The question of whether <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the <strong>longest debates in paleontology</strong>. Most paleontologists today accept that <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> was <strong>both a predator and a scavenger</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Fossil Record and Research</h2>
        <p>
            Some specimens of <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> are nearly complete skeletons. <strong>Soft tissue and proteins</strong> have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of the animal's biology, including its <strong>life history</strong> and <strong>biomechanics</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The feeding habits, physiology, and potential speed of <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> are a few subjects of debate. Its <strong>taxonomy is also controversial</strong>. The Asian <em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em> is very closely related to <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> and has sometimes been seen as a species of this genus. Several North American tyrannosaurids have been synonymized with <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, while some <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> specimens have been proposed as distinct species.
        </p>
        <p>
            The validity of these species, such as the more recently discovered <strong><em>T. mcraeensis</em></strong> from the late Campanian (~72–73 Ma) of New Mexico—which extends the genus's known range southward and potentially earlier—remains contentious due to specimen scarcity.<a href="#ref2" class="citation">[2]</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century. Science writer <strong>Riley Black</strong> has called it the <em>"ultimate dinosaur"</em>. Its fossils have been a popular attraction in museums and have appeared in media like <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>.
